Welcome to my Angular portfolio! This repository showcases my progression from TypeScript fundamentals to building full-stack Angular applications. Each project represents a step in my learning journey, demonstrating different concepts, patterns, and real-world applications.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This portfolio contains **4 distinct projects** that showcase different aspects of modern web development:

### 📚 **01-typescript-intro** - TypeScript Fundamentals
A comprehensive learning playground covering everything from basic types to advanced features like decorators and generics. Perfect for understanding the foundation that makes Angular so powerful.

### 🏗️ **02-bases** - Angular Core Concepts  
A full Angular 19 application demonstrating component architecture, routing, services, and modern state management with Signals. Features a Dragonball character management system with CRUD operations.

### 🎬 **03-gifs-app** - Real API Integration
A production-ready GIF browser built with Angular 19, Tailwind CSS, and the Giphy API. Showcases lazy loading, search functionality, and modern UI/UX patterns.

### 🌍 **04-country-app** - Advanced Angular Features
The latest project built with Angular 20, featuring standalone components, advanced routing, and integration with the REST Countries API. Demonstrates modern Angular best practices.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Bun** (for faster package management)
- **Angular CLI** (version 19+)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeonStyven/Angular
   cd Angular
   ```

2. **Choose your project** and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   cd 01-typescript-intro    # For TypeScript learning
   cd 02-bases              # For Angular fundamentals
   cd 03-gifs-app           # For API integration examples
   cd 04-country-app        # For modern Angular patterns
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or with Bun (faster!)
   bun install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   ng serve
   # or with Bun
   bun run start
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:4200`)
